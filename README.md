**NOTE: Post-acquisition, Twitter started making life difficult for applications like Treeverse that access twitter data. Since I don’t have time to play cat-and-mouse games with a hostile platform, I'm retiring Treeverse.** The codebase of Treeverse dates back to a bookmarklet I wrote in 2014. It’s been a pleasure to see something started as a curiosity project picked up by the OSINT and archivist communities. Thanks to everyone who shared their enthusiasm over the years.

Introduction
------------

After installing Treeverse for your browser, open Twitter and click on the tweet that you would like to visualize the conversation of (or try [this one](https://twitter.com/paulgb/status/977652162137395201).)

If you’re using Chrome, the icon for Treeverse should turn from grey to blue in your browser. Click it to enter Treeverse.

If you're using Firefox, the icon will be hidden until you open a tweet, and then it will appear in the address bar.

Exploring the Conversation
--------------------------

Conversations are visualized as a tree. Each box is an individual tweet, and
an line between two boxes indicates that the lower one is a reply to the upper
one. The color of the line indicates the time duration between the two tweets
(red is faster, blue is slower.)

As you hover over nodes, the reply-chain preceeding that tweet appears on the right-side
pane. By clicking a node, you can freeze the UI on that tweet in order to interact with
the right-side pane. By clicking anywhere in the tree window, you can un-freeze the tweet
and return to the normal hover behavior.

Some tweets will appear with a red circle with white ellipses inside them, either overlayed
on them or as a separate node. This means that
there are more replies to that tweet that haven't been loaded. Double-clicking a node will
load additional replies to that tweet.

Privacy
-------

Treeverse runs entirely in your browser. No data is collected or tracked by Treeverse directly
when you use or install it. Browser extension installs may be tracked by Google and Mozilla, and the data
requests made to Twitter may be tracked by Twitter.

When you create a sharable link, the data is sent to a server so that it can be made available to other
users. Access to the shared link server may be tracked to prevent abuse.

Additionally, when Treeverse runs it loads a font hosted by Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/). Google may track this download.
